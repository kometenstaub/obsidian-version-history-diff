# Version History Diff (for Sync and File Recovery Core plugins and Git)

## Note

This plugin uses private APIs, so it may break at any time. Use at your own risk.

## Features

It can 

1. display diffs of the **Sync** 
2. and the **File Recovery** 
3. and **Git** version history for the currently active file, 
   - For this to work, the [Obsidian Git](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-git) plugin needs to be installed.
4. open a selected version in a modal and 
5. render it as either markdown or 
6. plain text and 
7. you can overwrite the file with this version as well. 
8. There is a colour-blind mode
9. And you can switch between `line-by-line` and `side-by-side` view in the settings. The latter is only recommended on bigger screens.

The reason for showing you the note before you revert to this state is that the diffs can be misleading.

## Usage

There are two columns. The chosen version on the right side should be newer than the one on the left side for the diffs to make sense.

I personally find the file recovery diffs better as they are less frequent, but the Sync diffs might be helpful as well.

For *Sync*, it only displays the Sync versions. For *File Recovery* and *Git*, it also shows the current state of the file from disk as latest version.

The Git diff lets you copy the hash by clicking on it. By default, only the first seven characters are copied. `Shift-click` to copy the full hash.

## Credits

All licenses and attributions can be found in the `esbuild.mjs` file for the code (and therefore in the `main.js` release), the CSS license is in `src/styles.scss`. Should any license/attribution be missing, please let me know, and I will look into it.


Special thanks to @SlRvb for adapting the CSS to Obsidian and making the colour-blind mode and to @Vinzent03 for creating the necessary APIs in the Obsidian Git plugin.
